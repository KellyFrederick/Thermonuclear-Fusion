PHY250 Project

	The project will consist of various python programs written to display solutions to problems related to the generation of energy from thermonuclear fusion. Problems from among the following  are to be implemented in python and displayed appropriately.
1.	Application of quantum mechanical tunneling through a potential barrier to radioactive decay by alpha particle emission [Wave Mechanics for Engineers, J. N. Anno, Lexington Books, 1976].  Theoretically calculated decay constants are compared to experimentally measured values. 

2.	Application of quantum mechanical tunneling through a potential barrier to calculation of D-T fusion reaction cross section [Wave Mechanics for Engineers, J. N. Anno, Lexington Books, 1976].  Theoretically calculated D-T cross sections are compared to experimentally measured values.  Experimental data obtained from W. R. Arnold et al., Phys. Rev. 93, 483 (1954) and the 1995 ENDF data by G. M. Hale and M. Drosg from the BNL website http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor/endf00.htm will be used.  Fits to experimental data obtained from H.-S. Bosch and G. M. Hale, Nucl. Fusion 32, 611 (1992) may also be shown.

3.	An onset criterion for radiation driven islands in combination with a simple cylindrical model of tokamak current channel behavior was derived by D. A. Gates and L. Delgado-Aparicio [PRL 108, 165004 (2012)].   This theory will be compared with the empirical scaling of the tokamak density limit for Ohmic-heated plasmas known as the Greenwald limit, M. Greenwald, Nucl. Fusion 28, 2199 (1988).

4.	A theoretical density limit in an Ohmically heated plasma was derived by F.W. Perkins and R. A. Hulse [Phys. Fluids 28, 1837 (1985)] based on the Ohmic heating power being exceeded by the impurity radiative cooling in the current-carrying channel. These theoretical results are compared with the Murakami density limit [M. Murakami, J. D. Callen and L. A. Berry, Nucl. Fusion 16, 347 (1976)].

5.	Plasma and neutral fueling density limits in tokamak were derived by W. M. Stacey [Phys. Plasmas 4, 1069 (1997)] based on the stability of the radial temperature and density profiles against radial collapse.  These theoretical results are compared with the Greenwald limit, M. Greenwald, Nucl. Fusion 28, 2199 (1988).  Auxiliary-heated plasmas were found to have higher density limits than Ohmic heated plasmas and fusion alpha-heated plasmas were found to have lower density limits than Ohmic-heated plasmas, for comparable plasma conditions.  However, these predictions were made for plasmas with argon impurities.  Calculations will be done with the reactor relevant carbon and tungsten impurities.  The scaling with auxiliary-heating power will be examined.

6.	The MARFE (multifaceted asymmetric radiation from the edge) is considered a precursor of the tokamak density limit, although not directly related. A theory in which the edge density at which the uniform k|| â‰ˆ 0 modes become unstable (the MARFE onset condition) was derived by W. M. Stacey [Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 39, 1245 (1997); Fusion Technol. 36, 38 (1999)].  This theory was compared with TEXTOR [Tokamak Experiment for Technology Oriented Research] experiment over a range of heating powers, F. A Kelly, W.M. Stacey, J. Rapp and M. Brix, Phys. Plasmas 8, 3382 (2001).

7.	Experiments in NSTX (National Spherical Torus Experiment) were compared with a MARFE theory [M.A. Mahdavi, et al., in: Proceedings of 24th European Conference on Controlled Fusion and Plasma Physics, vol. 21A, European Physical Society, Berchtesgaden, Germany, 1997, p. 1113] in which used the non-equilibrium radiation effect of neutrals in a uniform edge distribution to obtain a MARFE density limit. The electron temperature and density together with the carbon fraction, fC = nC/ne, were measured and neutral fraction, f0 = n0/ne, was estimated to be approximately 10-3 with the XGC0 code.  The MARFE theory agreed with NSTX experiments except at high density where the neutral fraction may have been higher [F. Kelly, R. Maingi, R. Maqueda, J. Menard, S. Paul, J. Nucl. Mater. 390-391, 436 (2009)].

8.	Predictions of the scrape-off-layer plasma characteristics for the national high-power advanced torus experiment (NHTX) were made with the 2D edge modeling code SOLPS [J.M. Canik, R. Maingi, L. Owen, J. Menard, R. Goldston, M. Kotschenreuther, P. Valanju, S. Mahajan, J. Nucl. Mater. 390-391, 315 (2009)]. The calculations were made with 30 MW of auxiliary heating power from neutral beam injection (NBI) and the assumption of a fixed impurity fraction, fI = nI/ne, of 4% for the impurity species carbon, neon and argon. It will argued that these impurity assumptions are completely unrealistic since the measured carbon fraction in NSTX edge plasma at 6 MW of NBI heating power were always greater than 4% and sometimes exceeded 10% [F. Kelly, R. Maingi, R. Maqueda, J. Menard, S. Paul, J. Nucl. Mater. 390-391, 436 (2009)].

9.	Computerized Tomographic Imaging methods will be used simulate the measurement of the electron temperature and density and impurity densities with a new plasma diagnostic.  The measurements will then be used to reconstruct the profiles in the plasma.  A python program will generate the plasma profiles used as input.

10.	The role of plasma-wall interactions on thermal instabilities in tokamak edge plasmas was investigated by M. Z. Tokar and F. A. Kelly, Phys. Plasmas 10, 4378 (2003).  The role of thermal instabilities and anomalous transport in the threshold of detachment and MARFE onset was modelled in M. Z. Tokar, F. A. Kelly, and X. Loozen,  Phys. Plasmas 12, 052510 (2005).  These theories will implemented in a python program and compared with experimental data from TEXTOR and NSTX.
